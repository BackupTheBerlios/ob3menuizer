Customizing - 
	The ob3_term and ob3_editor programs can (and should) be set to your liking.  Open them in a text editor and find the line:
"PROG_LIST="
Make sure your preferred application is FIRST in the list.  Example
PROG_LIST="tea kedit gedit SciTE beaver nedit cute"
I prefer using tea for quick edits, so I have tea listed first.

Menu Generation - 
	After installation you can run the menu generator program by entering 
openbox-autogen_menu
in your terminal.  The program will attempt to back up any existing menu found in ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml .  It is highly recommended you keep a seperate backup copy.  To use the new menu, you will likely have to restart openbox3.
