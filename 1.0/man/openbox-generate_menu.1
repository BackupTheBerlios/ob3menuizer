.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBopenbox-generate_menu\fP scans the users PATH and writes a functional
.TP
.B
root menu for the openbox3 window manager.
The file is saved as
.TP
.B
$HOME/.config/openbox/menu.xml.
Any existing menu.xml file is 
.TP
.B
renamed to menu.xml.bak so that a backup is retained.
.PP
\fBopenbox-generate_menu\fP tests to be sure it can write the file before 
.TP
.B
any action is preformed by the program.
If the program is unable
to write the menu file, it exits with an error.
.SH HINTS
.TP
.B
Several entries in the autogenerated menu use the sudo package.
Sudo is very secure if set up correctly, and it is the recommended
.TP
.B
way to use these commands.
Please see the sudo package for your
distribution as well as the sudo documents.
